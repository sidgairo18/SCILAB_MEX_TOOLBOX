                Geometry Processing Toolbox
       
         ================================================

About:

This is the Geometry Processing Toolbox. This only supports the /mex files and functions in this toolbox.
It serves as a reference for the "mexlib" module in Scilab.

This will give you an introduction or starting point of how to use the
 MEX API in SCILAB and how to port a mex toolbox.

- See SCILAB help for mexlib and SCI/modules/mexlib/srct/mexlib.c for 
  additional info and in  particular the list of emulated mx functions.

Refer below link for more details -

Dependencies:

1. Scilab >= 6.0.1 (http://www.scilab.org/) (May work on lower versions too with mex support)
2. c++11
3. Eigen
4. libigl
5. CGAL
    5.1 BOOST
    5.2 GMP
    5.3 MPFR
6. Embree
7. El Topo

Note: Libigl is by default a header only library. You do not need to compile it to use it (though you do need to compile and link to any dependencies, e.g. CGAL).

Building and Loading: 

1. Set the path of the libraries relative to the local machine running this toolbox in file ./src/cppmex/builder.sce
2. Execute runner.sce to compile and load the functions in the Toolbox.

(Make sure to set absolute paths only)

NOTE - This work was done as a part of GSoC 2018 to port an existing mex toolbox for SCILAB. These are only mex function files which can be loaded in Scilab and run.
Please refer to https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/tree/master/mex which is the GP Toolbox from which the functions were ported for Scilab. The builder.sce and
runner.sce file have been implemented accordingly.
