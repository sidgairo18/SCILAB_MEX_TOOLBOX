                Geometry Processing Toolbox
       
         ================================================

About:

This is the Geometry Processing Toolbox. This only supports the /mex files and functions in this toolbox.
It serves as a reference for the "mexlib" module in Scilab.

Refer below link for more details -
- Link : https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox/tree/master/mex

Dependencies:

1. Scilab >= 6.0.1 (http://www.scilab.org/) (May work on lower versions too with mex support)
2. c++11
3. Eigen
4. libigl
5. CGAL
    5.1 BOOST
    5.2 GMP
    5.3 MPFR
6. Embree
7. El Topo

Note: Libigl is by default a header only library. You do not need to compile it to use it (though you do need to compile and link to any dependencies, e.g. CGAL).

Building and Loading: 

1. Set the path of the libraries relative to the local machine running this toolbox in file ./src/cppmex/builder.sce
2. Execute runner.sce to compile and load the functions in the Toolbox.

(Make sure to set absolute paths only)
